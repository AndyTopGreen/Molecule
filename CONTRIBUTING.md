## Code Style Guide

- Use lowerCamelCase as a naming convention (It is very common in JS
to use firstName, lastName).
- Use 4 spaces (soft tabs), instead tabs (hard tabs).
- No trailing whitespace on blank lines.
- Always use strict equal === unless you need to do any type conversion.
- Use single quotation mark ' instead double quotation mark ".
- Comments should have their own line, no trailing comments, and the
line above should be empty
- on if/for etc. there should always be brackets, even though not
needed (often you put more into the if, and then you do not have to
add them again).
- Always use literal notation, no new Array(), but [].
